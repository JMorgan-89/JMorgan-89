<h1>Hi, I'm Josh Morgan! <br/>

<h2>About Me </h2>
Hello Hiring Managers and Recruiters,<br><br>

Hello Hiring Managers and Recruiters,

  I am a highly motivated and ambitious technologist with a passion for technology that began at a young age. My journey started with playing PC video games, which sparked my curiosity about how everything worked. At 15, I began building gaming machines and have never looked back. People often bring their machines to me for upgrades, recognizing my technical skills. To improve my customer service skills, I started my own auto detailing business, which involved peer-to-peer contact with customers and working on their long-term investments. This experience has honed my communication, problem-solving, and customer service skills.

  I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from Western Governors University. My education at WGU exposed me to various IT domains, including software development and programming concepts, hardware components and troubleshooting, project management principles and methodologies, MySQL and database management fundamentals, web design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, networking, and security.

  I am seeking IT Support or Support Analyst role where I can apply my technical skills and knowledge. I am eager to get my foot in the door with a company and start my career in IT. I am committed to continuous learning and growth in the IT field.
